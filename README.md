ARMageddon is a space sci-fi 2-D platformer that takes place on a spaceship. When you first launch the game you are presented with a title screen with the games title and instructions to continue, which then takes your to the beginning of the game. Your main goal of the game is to make your way through the level battling other robots to reach the final boss room, hopefully defeating the final boss. The game follows the basic flow of many other games allowing you to move left with the A key, right with the D key, and jump with the spacebar. The robot also comes with a default attack that punches in front of itself by left clicking. The main game mechanic for Armageddon is that when certain robots are defeated that they will drop powerups specific to there own combat abilities. These power ups must be interacted with, by clicking the E key, and can give you a variety of different powers including a laser sword, flamethrower, blaster, or drill charge attack. Furthermore the powerups replace the basic attack permenantely and can be replaced with another powerup by simply interacting with it. You are also presented with a visual HUD showing your current health, powerup, and score. The enemies and final boss of the game also have health totals not shown to the player intentionally. For testing purposes the development team also included some cheat codes to help with testing purposes as follows:

- The key combination ALT and L gives the player togglable invincivility.
- The key combination ALT and O allows the player to restart the current scene they are in.
- The key combination ALT and G allows the player to completely restart the game.
- The key combination ALT and B teleports the player to just outside the bosses room.

CC0 Dedication:

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:

the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;

other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
